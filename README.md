# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Undeclared Variable in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications.  The error occurs when a page component attempts to access a variable that hasn't been declared, resulting in a runtime exception. This issue is particularly problematic because it may not be caught during development and only surfaces in production, leading to a 500 server error.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You'll initially see the error in the browser's console, and the page will render normally in development because Next.js development server handles such errors gracefully. However in production, you will get a 500 error. 

## Solution

The solution involves proper error handling and preventing the access of undeclared variables.  This can be accomplished using various methods, such as:

*   **Stricter type checking:** Use TypeScript to catch these errors during development.
*   **Conditional rendering:** Check if the variable exists before using it. 
*   **Optional chaining:** Use the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to safely access properties of potentially null or undefined objects.
*   **Default values:** Assign default values to variables to handle cases where they might be undefined.

The solution provided in `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates one approach to handling this specific scenario.
